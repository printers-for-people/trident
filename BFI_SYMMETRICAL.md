# Symmetrical BFI instructions

This describes how to assemble, and install, the [Symmetrical
BFI](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI/tree/main/usermods/Tetsu/Symetrical%20BFI).
These instructions are for the M3 version.

## Required parts

### Non-printed

* 2 x M5x16 BSHCS (can use extras in the kit)
* 4 x M3x30 SHCS
* 4 x M3 heatset insert
* 4 x M3 washer

You will also need the shims and bearings used to make the idler stacks: these
come with the kit, and are exactly the same as stock. 

To mount these to the frame, you will need:

* 4 x M3 T-nut
* 4 x M5 T-nut
* 4 x M3x10 BSHCS
* 4 x M5x10 BSHCS

The M5 hardware listed above will come from the kit; only the M3 hardware is
extra.

## Printed

* [`BFI-VT_Housing_symetrical_x2.stl`](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI/blob/main/usermods/Tetsu/Symetrical%20BFI/STLs/BFI-VT_Housing_symetrical_x2.stl),
  print in main colour
* [`BFI_Carrier_M3_symetrical_x2.stl`](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI/blob/main/usermods/Tetsu/Symetrical%20BFI/STLs/BFI_Carrier_M3_symetrical_x2.stl), 
  print in accent colour
* [`BFI_Front_with_logo_M3_symetrical_x2.stl`](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI/blob/main/usermods/Tetsu/Symetrical%20BFI/STLs/BFI_Front_with_logo_M3_symetrical_x2.stl),
  print in accent colour

The STLs are not correctly oriented: see the images below for proper orientation
on the build plate.

## Installation

TODO: Note that your T-nuts are different: M5 at the front, M3 at the back.

TODO: Means you need more screws too...

TODO: Mounting stiffness means it's easier to mount them before you close the
extrusions.

TODO: Note that screw wobble pre-belting is normal.
