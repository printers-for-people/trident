# Symmetrical BFI instructions

This describes how to assemble, and install, the [Symmetrical
BFI](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI/tree/main/usermods/Tetsu/Symetrical%20BFI).
These instructions are for the M3 version.

## Required parts

### Non-printed

* 2 x M5x16 BSHCS
* 4 x M3x30 SHCS
* 4 x M3 heatset insert

There are enough spare M5x16 BSHCSs in the kit to not require extras for this
mod: the BOM required 40, but the kit provides 43. For M3 heatset inserts, 
there aren't enough in the kit if you want a Stealthburner (77 provided, all 
required); if you want a Dragonburner, and are not using the TaiChi, V6 or 
Bambu mount, then you have enough (this leaves 5 spare from the kit, and you 
need 4), but with any of those mounts, you won't have enough. M3x30s are not
included in the kit, but there aren't enough of them (only 1 spare), so you will
need to source these yourself.

This does not include the parts required to attach the idlers to the frame:
these use the same parts that stock idlers would be attached with. It also
doesn't include the shims and bearings used for the stacks, as these are the
same as for the stock parts, and are also provided by the kit.

## Installation

TODO: Note that your T-nuts are different: M5 at the front, M3 at the back.

TODO: Means you need more screws too...

TODO: Mounting stiffness means it's easier to mount them before you close the
extrusions.

TODO: Note that screw wobble pre-belting is normal.
